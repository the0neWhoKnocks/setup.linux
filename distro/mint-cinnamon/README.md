## Pre-Install

I use [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) to install my distros, so just download the distro and drop it in the designated `isos` folder on your formatted USB drive. 

> **Issue: Ventoy won't boot**
> **Solution:** In order to allow Ventoy to load, you'll have to disable Secure Boot in the Bios. In some cases, to change the Secure Boot setting, you'll need to set a supervisor password. Once the password is set the Secure Boot option will no longer be grayed out and can be disabled.

> **Issue: Can't install Linux due to RST being enabled**
> **Solution:** Go into the Bios. Location may vary, for me I found it under Main &gt; Sata Mode &gt; Changed it from `RST Premium with Optane` to `AHCI`.

---

## Install

1. Once the distro boots into it's live environment, double-click the **Install** item that should be on the Desktop.
1. Choose the option to **Erase disk**, which should then ask you to choose the file system. I chose **ZFS**.
1. The next screen prompts to choose the disk to install to. I want to dual-boot Windows and Linux and am installing Linux to a freshly installed unformatted drive.

---

## Initial Boot

There's a splash screen that can hide potential issues during boot, so disable it while settings things up.
```sh
sudo vi /etc/default/grub
# Replace `splash` in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT with `nosplash`

sudo update-grub
```

---

## Set Up Display

I've had mixed results with Driver Manager (for installing the video driver), so this is the manual way of doing what it does.
- Check what video driver is currently being used
    ```sh
    lspci -k | grep -EA3 'VGA|3D|Display' | grep 'Kernel driver in use'
    # Should output a line with `nouveau` or `nvidia`.
    ```
    
    If using an `nvidia` driver, you can find the version with
    ```sh
    cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version | grep -E 'Kernel Module  [0-9]+'
    # or
    nvidia-smi | grep -E 'Driver Version: [0-9]+'
    
    # Should output a line with a highlighted number, which is the major version.
    ```
- List available drivers to install
    ```sh
    ubuntu-drivers devices | grep 'driver  ' | grep -v '-server - '
    # Should output lines like
    # driver   : nvidia-driver-<VERSION> - distro non-free recommended
    # driver   : nvidia-driver-<VERSION> - distro non-free
    # --
    # driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin
    ```
    
    Generally use the `recommended` driver, then try the versions below it if you have issues.
- Install the driver
    ```sh
    sudo apt install <DRIVER>
    # <DRIVER> being something like `nvidia-driver-450` or `xserver-xorg-video-nouveau`
    ```
    
    If you want to uninstall a driver
    ```sh
    sudo apt remove nvidia-driver-<VERSION> && sudo apt autoremove
    ```

<br />
<br />

If you have multiple monitors, launch **Display**
- Select your main monitor and toggle it to `Set as Primary` if it isn't already set.
- Set the `Rotation` of other monitors if they're rotated.
- Drag monitors roughly into the correct positions.
- Apply, keep changes, rinse-and-repeat while adjusting monitor positions.
- Under **Settings** I also unchecked `Enable fractional scaling controls`. Not sure if it was actually hurting anything, but I disabled at during some troubleshooting and things have been stable so it stays off for now.

<br/>

Notes:
- If you have a dock that has one monitor hooked up, and another monitor is hooked up to a laptop, you may want to stick with the `nouveau` driver. It's the only one that's given me stable performance with a second monitor (via a dock).

---

## Installing / Updating the Kernel

I usually handle the kernel update via the Update Manager. Just be careful not to reboot before recompiling the NVidia modules (if you're using an NVidia video driver).

The theory is that after a kernel upgrade the new kernel is not active before the system is rebooted. To recompile the nvidia modules the new kernel needs to be active so this hasn’t been done as part of the upgrade process. So when one reboots after a kernel upgrade, the nvidia module is not able to communicate with the kernel (which usually leads to a user not being able to boot to the Desktop). The solution is to simply upgrade the `linux-headers-<VERSION>` which will automatically trigger a recompile of the nvidia kernels.
    ```sh
    sudo apt -y install "linux-headers-$(uname -r)"
    ```
    
    The drivers should start working again even without a reboot.
    ```sh
    # list installed driver
    dkms status
    # <ndvidia_driver_ver>, <kernel_ver>
    ```

---

## System Tweaks

- There's a limit of 15 characters for the `hostname` for `netbios`. You can run `testparm -s` to see if your hostname length is ok (when it's not you'll see `WARNING: The 'netbios name' is too long`).
    ```sh
    hostnamectl set-hostname '<NEW_NAME>'
    ```

---

## Create Common Directories

```sh
mkdir -v -p ~/{.ssh,Downloads/{archives,debs},Projects/{3D,Code/{Apps,Games,Gists,Scripts},Img,Vid},Software} && chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

---

## Don't Require Password for Sudo

```sh
echo "${USER} ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL" | (sudo EDITOR='tee -a' visudo)
```

---

## Install Base Software

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https git tilix vim
```

  <summary>[ Optional ] Expand for DisplayLink Install (for Targus dock)</summary>
  
  There are issues syncing monitors with DisplayLink on Linux especially when using Nvidia drivers.
  
  ```sh
  # Download and install DisplayLink driver
  wget https://cdn.targus.com/web/us/downloads/DisplayLink%20USB%20Graphics%20Software%20for%20Ubuntu.zip -O ~/Downloads/driver__Targus_USB_DisplayLink.zip
  unzip ~/Downloads/driver__Targus_USB_DisplayLink.zip -d ~/Downloads/Targus/
  # Install deps
  sudo apt install dkms
  # The next step will prompt for a restart, skip it.
  sudo ~/Downloads/Targus/displaylink-driver-*.run
  # Patch udev entry, otherwise the system will freeze during boot
  sudo vim /opt/displaylink/udev.sh
  ```
  ```diff
  # find the `start_service` function around line 104, and change to:
  - systemctl start displaylink-driver
  + systemctl start --no-block displaylink-driver
  
  # save and exit
  ```
  ```sh
  # Clean-up
  rm -rf ~/Downloads/Targus
  # reboot and verify things work
  sudo reboot
  ```
  
  If you want to remove displaylink, run:
  ```sh
  sudo displaylink-installer uninstall
  ```
  
  I ran into an issue where the system would freeze at the boot logo if the dock's USB was plugged in (only after the driver was installed). With the USB unplugged everything was fine. During boot I noticed it was hanging on the `udev` service. I ran `ls -la /etc/udev/rules.d/` and the only rule in there was `99-displaylink.rules` which was executing `/opt/displaylink/udev.sh`. I came across a few posts to fix the freeze during boot:
  - [Post that calls out real fix which calls out `--no-block`](https://support.displaylink.com/forums/287786-displaylink-feature-suggestions/suggestions/41424121-avoid-boot-time-stall-due-to-udev-rules)
  - There was another that said to use `sudo systemctl mask systemd-udev-settle`. It worked, but it didn't target the issue specifically and could have masked other issues.

## Clone This Repo

This is only required if you want to use the helper scripts.

```sh
cd ~/Projects/Code/Scripts && git clone git@github.com:the0neWhoKnocks/setup.linux.git && cd setup.linux/distro/mint-cinnamon
```

---

</details>

---

## Set Up Repos

I have a private gist that contains a shell script with all the `git clone` commands so I don't have to deal with finding all the repo URLs and remembering where everything should be cloned to. 

---

## Set Up Shares

Only required if you need access to a network share.

This an on-demand approach, like for a laptop that may not always be on your network. (requires [this step](#clone-this-repo))
```sh
(
  cd ./bin
  ./user-script.sh --install "${PWD}/lan-shares.sh" "LAN Shares" "Utility to mount or unmount network shares" "drive-multidisk" "-gui"
)
```
- Run the new Launcher that was added to the Desktop
  - Configure the settings for the share.
    - The mounted folder needs to be in `/media`, or it won't be automatically detected.

  Notes:<br/>
  The [instuctions for setting up the repo](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) are Ubuntu specific and call out `lsb_release -cs` which doesn't work on Mint. I created an alternative
  ```sh
  cat /etc/os-release | grep "UBUNTU_CODENAME" | sed "s|UBUNTU_CODENAME=||"
  ```
  I verified it was the correct name by going to https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/ to see the available names, and checking the Ubuntu releases https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases.
  
  [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/) now exists for Linux, but I've had issues with it:
  - Not being up-to-date
  - Trying to sell me something
  
  `docker-compose` has [been replaced](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/) with `docker compose`. The new [compose spec](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md) is more universal but it also deprecates some fields.

  The script will add an `export` line to your `.bashrc`. If you use another shell, copy that line to your `*rc` file and source your shell. Once that's done, you can choose and install the version of NodeJS that you want.

## Configure Software

At this point you should probably restart so things like the GPU driver and Display Manager can do their initial boot stuff. You may experience some odd boot stuff the first time around, and a second reboot may solve any quirks.

During boot you may see a bunch of lines printed in the terminal before the login screen appears. There may be some errors hidden in there. After you log in, you can check for errors by running
```sh
dmesg | grep -i "error\|warn\|fail"
```

  - **Issue: ACPI BIOS Error**
    <details>
      <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
      
      Apparently this has been [a known issue](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=371358) and can be ignored. 
      ```sh
      sudo vim /etc/default/grub
      # Replace `quiet` in the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT with `loglevel=3`
      
      sudo update-grub
      ```
    </details>
</details>
<br>
<br>


If you have a previous backup that utilized `dconf`, you can restore it now which may save you some configuration time.
```sh
# Restore GNOME settings
dconf load / < ~/settings.dconf

# If you want to import keys for specific packages, the only thing I've found is to copy those sections to another `.dconf` file and run the same command above but with the new file. 
```
<br>


If you have any self-signed certificates that your browsers utilize, you'll need to install them now.
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates
sudo cp <CERT_NAME>.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
sudo update-ca-certificates
```
- In some cases, changes don't take effect right away and a restart may be required.
- In some cases a restart doesn't work, for example Browsers sometimes have their own certificate area where you have to manually add a cert. For example, in Chrome you can go to Settings > search for `cert` > click Security > click Manage Certificates > go to Authorities and add your cert.
<br>


If you have any back-ups of your keyrings, you'll need to install those especially if any Browsers have saved credentials locally and you're bringing those profiles over.  
- After initially copying over the `.local/share/keyrings` files, you'll need to open up the **System Monitor** and kill `gnome-keyring-daemon`.
   - If that doesn't work, then `systemctl --user stop gnome-keyring && systemctl --user start gnome-keyring`.
- Then open up **Passwords and Keys** and unlock the **Login** item. Then you can open up stuff like Chrome or anything that has locally saved passwords.
<br>


Control your monitor's temperature (limit blue light). For now `redshift` and `redshift-gtk` come pre-installed so just do the below.
```sh
# NOTE: This file could conflict with the 'qredshift' applet so just use 'Redshift'
cp -i ./files/redshift.conf ~/.config/
```
Launch **Redshift** (it starts `redshift-gtk` and adds it to the bottom bar). Right-click on it and check `Enabled` and `Autostart`.

  <summary>Expand for File Manager</summary>
  
  I've tried `dolphin`, `nemo`, and `thunar`.
  - `dolphin` had the benefit of natural sorting which all othe managers seem to lack currently, but it's slow to load and currently doesn't allow for excluding paths from thumbnail generation.
  - `nemo` ships with Cinnamon but it currently suffers from thumbnail generation issues (sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, or doesn't generate thumbs for all types).
  - `thunar` ships with XFCE. It's snappy, allows for **Custom Actions** via context menus that you can easily write yourself, and allows for defining rules for thumbnail generation.

  Install Thunar and dependencies
  ```sh
  (
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:christian-boxdoerfer/fsearch-stable
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install fsearch thunar thunar-archive-plugin tumbler-plugins-extra
  )
  ```
  
  Thunar uses `tumbler` for generating thumbnails. Most File Managers have options to not show thumbnails on network paths, but `cifs` mounts may not fall under that category even though they can be. This will instruct `tumbler` what paths to ignore in that case.
  ```sh
  (
    # Clear any generated thumbnails
    rm -rf  ~/.cache/thumbnails/*
    # Create rc file for tumbler
    mkdir ~/.config/tumbler
    cp /etc/xdg/tumbler/tumbler.rc ~/.config/tumbler
    # Exclude specific paths from having thumbnails generated
    vi ~/.config/tumbler/tumbler.rc
  )
  ```
  ```
  # Find all the instances of `Excludes=` and add the paths
  Excludes=<PATH1>;<PATH2>
  ```
  `tumblerd` can't be restarted so you have to log out/in

     ```
  - Add your scripts (I symlink to ensure things keep in sync):
     ```sh
     ln -s "${PWD}/files/thunar/copy-filename.sh" ~/.config/Thunar/actions/
     ln -s "${PWD}/files/thunar/copy-full-path.sh" ~/.config/Thunar/actions/

     ln -s "${PWD}/files/thunar/view-metadata.py" ~/.config/Thunar/actions/

  - If you need to debug scripts, run `tail -f ~/.xsession-errors`, and try using your action.

  <summary>Expand for Cairo-Dock Settings</summary>
  
  If you want to switch from OpenGL go into `~/.config/cairo-dock/.cairo-dock` and update:
  ```diff
  - default_backend=opengl
  + default_backend=cairo
  ```
  
  To have it start on boot go into **Startup Applications**. `Add > Choose Applications > pick Cairo-Dock`.
  
  In order to add launchers to the dock, I go into the taskbar menu and search for the application. Once I find the application you can sometimes just drag it right to the dock, but more often than not I just right-click the app and choose `Add to desktop`. Then I can drag that launcher to the dock.
  
  Note that when a launcher is added to the dock, a copy of it is added to `~/.config/cairo-dock/current_theme/launchers`. So if a launcher needs to be updated, I'll generally just delete it and add the new one, but you can go in and manually edit the launcher in that folder.
  
  When manually creating a launcher I look to see if there's a good system icon via `cuttlefish` instead of pointing to an image. Some apps like system binaries may not have an icon, so you can find/create one and add it to the appropriate folder in `~/.local/share/icons`. More info on that in the [Theming](#theming) section.
    - After an update in Mint, I noticed some icons I was previously using were no longer available in the current theme. You can see what icon theme is in use under `Cairo-dock > Configuration > Appearance > Icons`. It seems to default to `_Custom Icons_` which is located at `/home/<USER>/.config/cairo-dock/current_theme/icons/`, and allows you to drop custom icons (SVG or PNG) directly in there. You can reference the files the same way as system icons, for example if you have `code.svg` you can reference it as `code` in the Launcher `Icon > Image's name or path` section. Missing icons may still exist within a different theme, so in a file browser you can open up `/usr/share/icons/` and search for the name that was previously being used, then just copy that file over to `<CAIRO>/current_theme/icons/`.
  
  Had an issue where Cairo wasn't using my default File Manager to open folders. It must be caching it somewhere because after I went into Default Applications, and changed my File Manager to something else, and then back to what I wanted, it started behaving.

  ```sh

    # To configure the theme, create a custom config for sddm
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/sddm.conf.d
    sudo cp -i ./files/sddm/10-custom.conf /etc/sddm.conf.d/
    
    # Then a custom config for the theme, adjust values as you see fit (these changes will persist after theme updates)
    sudo cp -i ./files/sddm/theme.conf.user /usr/share/sddm/themes/breeze/
  )
  ```
  
  You can test the theme via: `sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/breeze`. If there are errors, you may want to pick a different theme.
  
  The backgrounds for a theme are set in `/usr/share/sddm/themes/<THEME>/theme.conf` on the `background=` line.
  Generally themes point to the global wallpapers so an image can be displayed for any user. Those wallpapers are in `/usr/share/wallpapers`.
  To more easily view all wallpapers I open that directory with a file manager, and do a search for `screenshot.jpg`, then I can just browse through the results, and find the path for the wallpaper I want.
  Once you have a wallpaper you like, create/update your config's background line, and you'll see the new image after a reboot. Note that you'll see your User wallpaper on the lock screen.
  
  If your user icon isn't showing up, look in `/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/` and see if an icon exists with your user name. If not, try picking and choosing an icon again from **Account Details**.
  
  If you have multiple monitors hooked up, things will likely be jacked up when the login screen appears. Here's how to fix it:
  ```sh
  # get info about connected monitors
  xrandr | grep -w connected
  # In my case the output was:
  # --------------------------
  ## HDMI-0 connected 1080x1920+1920+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 531mm x 299mm
  ## DP-1 connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
  ## DP-3 connected primary 1920x1080+0+423 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 531mm x 299mm
  # --------------------------
  # HDMI-0 is my secondary vertical monitor to the right of my primary DP-3. DP-1 is the closed laptop.
  
  # add rules so the login behaves
  sudo vim /usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsetup
  # -------------------------------------
  xrandr --output DP-3 --auto --primary
  xrandr --output HDMI-0 --right-of DP-3 --rotate left --noprimary
  # -------------------------------------
  ```
  
  If `sddm` isn't behaving, you can revert to the default with `sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm`.

  - Install Python extension, but then remove auto-installed `isort` and `Jupyter` extensions. Seems to be a bug that'll spin up a few python processes for those extensions, and if you uninstall them, they keep running even after vscode is shut down, so you'll have to manually kill them. Open System Monitor, filter by `py`, the Process Name will be `python`, mouse over them to verify they were started by vscode. In some cases I'd have to delete `~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/<HASH>` (sort by date, usually the newest one, but can verify by looking at the path in the `workspace.json` file)
     - Remove MS Python extensions, syntax highlighting seems to work without them.
     - Search for Typescript and disable everything under `Svelte > Plugin`
     - `~/.vscode/argv.json`, add `"disable-hardware-acceleration": true`

  I was using `notepadqq` but it started taking a very long time to open.

  Xed comes default with Mint, but it requires a little customization.

  - Styles will come from https://github.com/trusktr/gedit-color-schemes
     - There are a few places where styles could possibly go. Run `ls -la /usr/share/gtksourceview-*/styles`, and take note of the folders that have a `styles.rng` file. For each one of those folders, you'll need to create a `.local` version where you'll dump the custom styles.
        ```sh
        # currently these folders match the above criteria
        mkdir -p ~/.local/share/{gtksourceview-3.0,gtksourceview-4}/styles
        ```
     - Now you can copy the contents of the repo's `gtksourceview-3.0/styles` folder over to the new folders.
        ```sh
        (
          wget https://github.com/trusktr/gedit-color-schemes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -O ~/Downloads/geditcolors.zip

  When running some commands via `sudo` you may notice things don't look or behave the same. Here are some things I copy over:
  ```sh
  (
    sudo cp -r ~/.config/lsd /root/.config/
    sudo cp ~/.vimrc /root/
  )
  ```

Now that things are set up, you should:
- Back things up
   ```sh
   # Back up GNOME settings
   dconf dump / > ~/settings.dconf
   ```
- Change Grub to something less noisy
   ```sh
   sudo vim /etc/default/grub
   ```
   ```diff
   - GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet nosplash loglevel=3"
   + GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash loglevel=3"
   ```
   ```sh
   sudo update-grub

## Back Up or Restore Data

### Backing up data

Note: You may get `EACCESS` errors for certain system files/folders if not running as `root`. One way to get around that is to disable locking.
```sh
# run
code ~/.config/FreeFileSync/GlobalSettings.xml
```
```diff
- <LockDirectoriesDuringSync Enabled="true"/>
+ <LockDirectoriesDuringSync Enabled="false"/>
```
This could have unexpected syncing results if applications are running in the background so try to exit everything before starting a sync.

1. I created a folder on my backup drive called `Linux_Mint__Laptop__Pred`.
    - `Pred` is just a manufactures identifier in case I make a backup from another laptop also running Linux Mint.
1. Open up `FreeFileSync`
1. Set up a config: <br/>
    Generally these are my synchronization settings:
    ```
    [ Comparison ]
      Variant: File Content
    
    [ Filter ]
      Include:
        *:
      
      Exclude:
        */.Trash-*/
        */.recycle/
    
    [ Synchronization ]
      Variant: Mirror
      Delete and overwrite: Recycle bin
    ```
    You have to set them for every config, unless you start working on another config with previous config settings loaded. If you do start working from a previous config, be careful not to overwrite it. I generally click `Save As` when I know I'm starting on a new config.
    
    <br/>
    
    Note: System environment variables can be used in paths. So instead of hardcoded paths to a User directory like `/home/johndoe/stuff` you'd use `%HOME%/stuff`.
    ```
    [ Compare column ]
      Drag & drop (input): (You can directly input a path, or click 'Browse')
      (click the '+' to add another path, though sometimes it's better to add a top-level folder and exclude what you don't want)
    
    [ Synchronize ]
      Drag & drop (input): (You can directly input a path, or click 'Browse')
    ```
1. Run the backup
    - With a config loaded and selected, click the `Compare` button.
    - Take note of the icons in the Action column (swirling green arrows). If it's a trash icon, the files/folders will be deleted. Just be mindful of that before proceeding.
    - If things look good, click `Synchronize`.
1. If you want, you can zip up that backup folder and store it somewhere as a snapshot.


### Restoring data

1. Load and select a config.
1. There's a `Swap Sites` button separating the Compare and Synchronization columns. Click on that to have your data go from the backup to the source.
1. Click `Compare`, review what will be changed.
1. If things look good, click `Synchronize`.
1. **Important**: Be sure not to save the config in the reversed state.

## Useful Keyboard Shortcuts

| Keys | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| `ALT + click on a window + drag` | Moves a window |
| `ALT + right-click near window edge + drag up/down or left/right` | Resize a window |
| `CTRL+ALT+ESC` | Restart Cinnamon (keeps current session, may jumble window positions) |
| `CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE` | Restart XOrg (exits to login) |

---

## Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `sudo apt autoremove <PACKAGE>` | Can be used after a `apt remove <PACKAGE>` or in place of. A reason to use it after a `remove` would be to ensure that you don't accidentally remove something because a dependency wasn't tracked properly. But if you just added something and know that there won't be any conflicts use `autoremove`. |
| `sudo add-apt-repository --remove <REPO>` | It's a common one, but I always forget the syntax. You'd think there'd be a `remove-apt-repository`. |
| `xev | grep keycode` | Prints out keycodes as you type |
| `xprop | grep WM_CLASS` | (click on an open window) prints the window class of an app. Aids in finding things on the system |

## Theming

### GTK Themes and Apps

Recommended tools:
- `GtkInspector`
   ```sh
   # If `libgtk-3-dev` isn't installed, do so
   sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
   
   # Enable with
   gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true
   ```
- Color picker
   ```sh
   sudo apt install gpick
   # although I magically have mate-color-select installed as well...
   ```

File locations:
- CSS
   ```
   ~/.config/gtk-3.0/colors.css # color definitions
   ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css # just imports `colors.css`
   /usr/share/themes/<THEME>/gtk-3.0/gtk.css # theme specific styling/overrides
   ```

Sources:
- https://gtkthemingguide.vercel.app/#/getting_started
  - Source: https://github.com/surajmandalcell/Gtk-Theming-Guide/blob/master/getting_started.md
- https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/css-properties.html

Updating Styles:
- With an App focused (I right-clicked the bottom panel and opened Panel Preferences), hit `CTRL+SHIFT+I` and it should open with that App's items listed in the Objects view. If that doesn't work you can try running the App in the CLI prefixed with `GTK_DEBUG=interactive`. You may be in the Details view, if so click on the Show All Objects button (top left).
- You can click on items in that view, and they'll blink/highlight if they're viewable. Once you find an item, double-click on it to open it's Details view. There's a drop-down, switch it to `CSS Nodes`. There you can find `ID`s, `Style Classes`, `CSS Property`s, and `Location`s. You can use `ID`s and `Style Classes` as you would ids and classes in CSS. `Location` is useful to determine if there's a hardcoded value in a CSS file somewhere, or if it's being controlled dynamically `<data>:##:##`.
- With the info from that view, go to the `CSS` view. Anything you add in there will take effect immediately. Test it with something like
   ```css
   #PanelWindow {
     background-color: #FF00FF;
   }
   ```
  Most items you can just select their Properties, then inspect from there.
- Add your custom styles to `~/.config/gtk-3.0/custom.css`, then open `~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css` and add `@import "custom.css";`. For changes to take effect I logged out and back in.
- When you're done, you may want to disable the `GtkInspector` key bindings so you don't get any unexpected keyboard conflicts
   ```sh
   gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding false
   ```


### Icons

- [Icon Theme Spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html)
- [Icon Naming Spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html)
- Global icons (usually used by themes) are in `/usr/share/icons/<THEME>/<TYPE>/<SIZE>/`. So if there's an icon you like, but you want to modify it, that's where it may be.

Before creating or finding my own icons I open up `cuttlefish` to see if there's something that'll work for me. If not, you can add a single icon in `~/.local/share/icons/`.
For better compatibility (like having it show up in `cuttlefish`) I created a GIMP plugin to generate folders and the different sized icons.
1. Close GIMP if it's running
1. Symlink the plugin over `ln -s $PWD/files/gimp/nox_gen-freedesktop-icons.py ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins/`
1. The first time testing it, you can open GIMP via the terminal to see if there are any errors while loading.
1. Add your full resolution icon to `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/`. I tend to prefix my icons with `mine__` so I easily know what I've added.
1. Open that image in GIMP
1. In the top menu, go to NOX > (click) Gen Freedesktop Icons
1. Choose the icon type
1. (click) Generate
1. In `cuttlefish` you should now be able to look up your icon, and use that icon name where ever.

## Troubleshooting

### System going to sleep after a few seconds on the Login screen
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  The issue only happened when my system was docked and the lid was closed and I was using an external monitor.
  
  Normally you'd go into **Power Management** and set what the system should do when the lid is closed. Turns out that it has no effect in the Login screen, rather it's controlled by `logind`.
  
  First check what files are effecting `logind`:
  ```sh
  systemd-analyze cat-config systemd/logind.conf
  ```
  If you don't see any files with settings pertaining to `HandleLidSwitchExternalPower`, create a new one:
  ```sh
  sudo cp -i ./files/laptop-login.conf /usr/lib/systemd/logind.conf.d/
  # Save changes and run
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
  ```

### Kernel Panic error after choosing "recommended" nvidia driver
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  To fix the panic, during boot I chose Advanced in the Grub menu. In that sub-menu I went down the list of available `recovery-mode` options until one booted.
  
  From the menu I chose the Root shell option. Then I ran `ubuntu-drivers devices` (displays what Driver Manager shows). I found the bad driver name and ran:
  ```sh
  (
    apt purge nvidia-driver-525
    apt autoremove
    reboot
  )
  ```
  You should then be able to boot normally with the default `nouveau` driver. Open up Driver Manager and reinstall the nvidia driver that matches your kernel.
  
  To find the driver that matches your kernel, run `uname -r` to view the current kernel. Then compare that against the available nvidia drivers in Driver Manager. For me it was recommending `nvidia-driver-525` when my kernel was `5.15.0-56-generic`. So it should've been recommending `nvidia-driver-515`.

### "error: out of memory" on boot right after grub menu
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  Seems to be linked to using nvidia drivers https://bugs.launchpad.net/oem-priority/+bug/1842320.
  Add this to your Grub config, save and reboot.
  ```
  GRUB_GFXMODE=640x360
  ```
  
  If that doesn't work, I also purged all nvidia packages via Synaptic Package Manager. Had to manually find all `nvidia` packages with a `version` matching what was installed. Rebooted, and the system should now be using the `nouveau` driver. Use Driver Manager to install the `nvidia` driver again.

### Chrome Saved Passwords Not Showing Up in Settings
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  First, close Chrome while you're troubleshooting.
  
  Possible reasons for this:
  1. The `Login Data` file is missing from `~/.config/google-chrome/<Default|Profile>/` or it's read/write protected. Look at the other file permissions in a folder you haven't touched, and copy those. 
  1. The passwords in the database (`Login Data` is a sqlite3 file) were encoded with a system key that aren't on your new system. It should be stored in `~/.local/share/keyrings`.
  1. There's a corrupted value in `Login Data`. If Chrome can't read a value, it automatically considers everything broken and won't display anything. If you run [fix-chrome-creds.py](./bin/fix-chrome-creds.py) it'll create a fixed file on your desktop, and output all the values so you can see what may be broken, or worse case manually input the passwords. Example `./bin/fix-chrome-creds.py -f "~/.config/google-chrome/<PROFILE>/Login Data" -p "<KEY>"`. `<KEY>` would come from `Passwords and Keys > Login > Chrome Safe Storage`.

### PulseAudio Volume Notification Keeps Popping Up
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  Was having an issue where the PulseAudio volume change notification would keep popping up randomly when I wasn't adjusting volume. Usually would happen while using a Browser and a video would start playing.
  
  First you can debug Pulse's logs:
  ```sh
  systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.{socket,service}
  # Terminal #1
  LANG=C pulseaudio -vvvv --log-time=1 > ~/Desktop/pulseverbose.log 2>&1
  # Terminal #2 (or just stop the above process when you see the notification pop up)
  tail -f ~/Desktop/pulseverbose.log
  ```
  Most forums date this back to a long-standing issue with it detecting that the headphone jack is plugged in then unplugged. Sure enough I was seeing these random messages:
  ```
  [pulseaudio] module-alsa-card.c: Jack 'Headphone Jack' is now plugged in
  ```
  
  ```sh
  # stop the currently running service (if it's running)
  systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.{socket,service}
  # edit pulse's config
  sudo vim /etc/pulse/default.pa
  ```
  ```
  # Disable the below line
  load-module module-switch-on-port-available
  ```
  ```sh
  # start the service
  systemctl --user start pulseaudio.{socket,service}
  ```
  What the modules do:
  - `on-port-available` is the event that a port becomes usable, for example when you insert a mini jack.
  - `on-connect` is the event that a new device is connected which has an audio port, such as a usb dock.

  **NOTE: Turns out the below didn't work**. Pipewire didn't help at all, in fact it kept crashing after extended use. Keeping this for future reference.
  
  Change from PulseAudio to Pipewire by [following these instructions](https://trendoceans.com/enable-pipewire-and-disable-pulseaudio-in-ubuntu/).
  ```sh
  # First check and see if it's already installed and running
  systemctl --user status pipewire pipewire-session-manager
  
  # If it's not installed
  sudo apt install pipewire
  # Install audio client and some libs
  sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-pipewire libpipewire-0.3-{0,dev,modules} libspa-0.2-{bluetooth,dev,jack,modules} pipewire{,-{audio-client-libraries,pulse,bin,tests}}
  # Install WirePlumber
  sudo apt install wireplumber gir1.2-wp-0.4 libwireplumber-0.4-{0,dev}
  
  # Kill PulseAudio
  systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.{socket,service}
  systemctl --user mask pulseaudio
  
  # Copy over Pipewire configs
  sudo cp -vRa /usr/share/pipewire /etc/
  
  # Start up Pipewire
  systemctl --user --now enable pipewire{,-pulse}.{socket,service}
  
  # Your system may require a log-off/in, or a reboot
  ```
  If you need/want Pipewire's equivelant to PulseEffects
  ```sh
  flatpak install flathub com.github.wwmm.easyeffects

### File Managers randomly freeze when transfering CIFS files
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  Had random issues in file managers when transfering lots of small files at once. Basically I'd start a transfer, the manager would hang, couldn't close the transfer dialog and would have to kill the manager's proccess.
  
  When I added `vers=1.0` (like `sudo mount -t cifs -o vers=1.0`) the issue no longer happened but transfers were slower, and version `1.0` is less secure.
  
  After weeks of random troubleshooting I found an option in TrueNAS Scale, within each SMB share.
  - Select a share to bring up it's properties panel
  - Click **Advanced Options**
  - Scroll down and check **Enable SMB2/3 Durable Handles**
  - Save changes

### System Freezes/Locks When Entering Suspend
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  - Went into **Update Manager** > View > Linux Kernels > chose the oldest in the available `5.15` series (`5.15.0-25`). Waited for it to install, rebooted, used the Grub menu during boot to choose the older kernel. Tested suspend and logging out/in and things seem to be working now.
  - To ensure it doesn't boot to the bad kernel:
     - Launch **Update Manager** > View > Linux Kernels. Click on the bad installed kernel, click `Remove`.
     - That kernel probably just popped up in the Update Manager as an available update. Right-click it and choose `Ignore the current update for this package`. If you mistakenly ignored the wrong package, go into Edit > Preferences > Blacklist, and remove what you ignored.

### Can't Boot Past Grub Menu
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  Recently updated my GPU driver and after I rebooted I kept getting an "out of memory" error from `initramfs`. No matter what I tried there was no way to get to a terminal or recover anything, everything just crapped out.
  
  Luckily you can use a Live ISO to recover:
  - I loaded into Mint via VenToy
  - Started a Terminal in Mint
     ```sh
     # mounting a ZFS pool takes a little extra work
     (
       # the root pool where you normally boot into
       sudo zpool import -R /mnt rpool
       # the boot pool where Grub lives
       sudo zpool import -R /mnt/ bpool
       sudo mount -t exfat UUID=7B55-ECA0 /mnt/boot/efi
       # mount certain system folders so things can run normally
       for i in dev dev/pts proc sys; do sudo mount -v --bind /$i /mnt/$i; done
       sudo mount -v --bind /mnt/boot/efi/grub /mnt/boot/grub
     )
     # load into the pool like it's a new root system
     sudo chroot /mnt
     
     # if you can't install packages due to mirrors not being resolvable
     sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
       # add
       nameserver 8.8.8.8
     
     # if mirrors are out of date
     sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/official-packages-repositories.list
     
     # patch initramfs to keep it's file size down (fix 'out of memory')
     sudo vim /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf
       # update existing items to:
       MODULES=dep
       COMPRESS=xz
     
     # remove driver (adding or removing automatically re-builds initramfs)
     sudo apt remove nvidia-driver-515
     sudo apt autoremove
     # list available drivers
     ubuntu-drivers devices
     # install driver
     sudo apt install nvidia-driver-525
     # make sure Grub references any new files that may have been generated
     sudo update-grub
     
     exit
     
     # if you need to make any file back-ups, do so now while things are mounted
     
     reboot
     ```
  - The Grub menu wouldn't load after my changes, instead it was just the Grub console.
     ```sh
     # list available drives
     grub> ls
     # find which drive has the boot pool (without the slash it may print the label of `bpool`, otherwise look for a BOOT folder and make sure there isn't Windows stuff in it).
     grub> ls (hd2,gpt3)/
     
     # load things up
     # set root=(hd#,gpt#)
     grub> set root=(hd2,gpt3)
     # linux /BOOT/ubuntu_######/@/vmlinuz root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_###### boot=zfs
     grub> linux /BOOT/ubuntu_1yyx7k/@/vmlinuz root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_1yyx7k boot=zfs
     # initrd /BOOT/ubuntu_######/@/initrd.img
     grub> initrd /BOOT/ubuntu_1yyx7k/@/initrd.img
     grub> boot
     ```
  
  If you need to back things up to a flash drive:
  ```sh
  # FAT drives have a limit of around 4GB per file, so split into `4294967295` chunks
  # [Export]
  sudo tar -cvzf - /mnt/home/<USER>/ | split -b 4294967295 - "/media/mint/<FLASH_ID>/backup.tar.gz.part"
  
  # [Import]
  cd <DEST_FOLDER>
  cat /<FLASH_ID>/backup.tar.gz.part.* | tar xzvf -

### "Couldn't Connect to Accessibility Bus" Warnings When Opening/Starting Something From CLI
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  The fix is to `export` this variable:
  ```sh
  # `NO_AT_BRIDGE` to hide GTK "couldn't connect to accessibility bus" warnings (usually when running 'open'). It's been a known issue for a long time https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/at-spi2-core/+bug/1193236.
  export NO_AT_BRIDGE=1
  ```
  
  The comment's not neccessary (for whatever file you dump it in), but it could be useful when trying to remember why you added it.
  
  There are different schools of thought as to where to add the `export`. Personally I added it to my `.*rc` file, but it can be added to these locations as well:
  
  | File | Description |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | `/etc/profile` | Global exports. Executes first. Available to all shells. Just add the `export` line. |
  | `/etc/profile.d/<FILENAME>` | Global exports. Anything in `profile.d` is loaded by `/etc/profile`. Available to all shells. `<FILENAME>` could be something like `01_accessibility_bus_fix.sh`, and in that file you'd add the `export` line. The leading number is just to ensure execution order. |
  | `~/.profile` | User exports. Available to all shells. Just add the `export` line. |
  | `~/.*rc` | User exports. Available to specific shell. Just add the `export` line to your Shell's `rc` file. So `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc. |

### USB Drive Slow to Eject or Suffers Data Loss
<details>
  <summary>Expand for Solution</summary>
  
  Linux has a caching/buffering layer when writing files to a disk. Basically the file manager's copy progress dialog is inaccurate and none of them display the actual written to disk progress, but instead display the written to RAM progress. So if you safely eject the disk, it'll disappear from the system tray list making you think it's safe to remove, but if you are viewing the drive in the **Disks** tool you may see a spinner indicating that something is still going on. Basically if you don't wait for the tray notification saying that it's ok to remove the drive, you may suffer data loss or an unreadable drive.
  
  If you want accurate copy progress you have to alter the automount options for USB disks to either `flush` (which is the fastest) or `sync`. Unfortunately `flush` isn't supported by all disks so I was only able to try `sync` which was much slower than just transferring and waiting.
  
  To change the automount rules:
  - Run:
      ```sh
      # First run `mount` on the mounted drive to see what it's defaults are
      mount | grep <DISK_LABEL>
      
      # You may have to create/copy the mount_options.conf if it doesn't exist
      sudo cp /etc/udisks2/mount_options.conf.example /etc/udisks2/mount_options.conf
      ```
  - Open `mount_options.conf` and add the appropriate value.
      ```sh
      sudo vim /etc/udisks2/mount_options.conf
      ```
      ```
      [defaults]
      defaults=rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,sync
      
      # or
      
      [defaults]
      defaults=rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,flush
      ```
  - Eject, remove, and then re-insert your drive. The changes should be applied.
      ```sh
      # Run mount again to verify changes.
      mount | grep <DISK_LABEL>
      ```
  
  Further debugging can achieved by running these commands:
  ```sh
  # udev is the hotplug management daemon. Run the below to see what happens when you plug in a device.
  udevadm monitor --udev
  
  # The path for User rules is:
  /etc/udev/rules.d/
  # If you add a new rules file, reload the rules with:
  sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
  
  # The path for System rules is:
  /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/
  
  # Print info about your mounted drive (get the generated name from Disks)
  udisksctl info -b /dev/<DRIVE>
  
  # To see what happens when you plug a drive in, first plug the drive in, then run:
  udevadm test -a add $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/<DRIVE>)
  ```
